## About The Server

Welcome to the ChickenJockey SMP! We are a comfy, modded Minecraft server designed around the idea that players should be able to **opt-in** to harder content instead of being forced into it.

The overworld is cozy and colorful, perfect for builders and explorers. But if you want to go fight terrible things in weird dimensions, we absolutely support that too.

Whether you just want to build a cottage, hunt endgame bosses, or just hang out with friends using proximity voice chat, this pack has something for you.

## 🌲 Choose Your Path

The server is designed to accommodate three main playstyles seamlessly:

### 1. The Casual Path
Focus on decorating, farming, exploring cute new structures, and collecting critters. The world is filled with new animals, furniture blocks, and breathtaking biomes.

### 2. The Challenge Path
For the thrill-seekers. Tackle optional bosses from *Bosses of Mass Destruction*, delve into redesigned dungeons, or step through the portal into the sculk-infested "Otherside" dimension from *Deeper and Darker*.

### 3. The Social Path
Utilize **Simple Voice Chat** to talk to nearby players, participate in community events, and work on shared build projects at spawn.

## 📦 Modpack Highlights

Our modpack is custom-curated to balance performance, aesthetics, and gameplay depth without overwhelming the vanilla feel.

Here is a quick look at some of the key mods powering the experience:

### **World Generation & Immersion**
* **Terralith & Biomes O' Plenty:** A complete overhaul of the overworld generation, creating stunning, diverse landscapes using mostly vanilla blocks.
* **YUNG's Suite:** Massively improved Strongholds, Nether Fortresses, and other structures turned into proper dungeons.
* **Ecologics & Naturalist:** Adds biome-specific mobs (like camels, crabs, and bears) to make the world feel alive.

### **Quality of Life (QoL)**
* **Simple Voice Chat:** Essential proximity chat for hanging out.
* **Traveler's Backpacks:** Upgradeable storage you can wear on your back.
* **Waystones:** Discover and craft stones for easy teleportation across the map.
* **Gravestones:** Your items are stored safely in a grave when you die.
* **JEI (Just Enough Items):** Easily look up recipes for all the new items.

### **Performance**
We use a robust suite of optimization mods including **Sodium**, **Lithium**, and **Iris Shaders** to ensure the chaos runs smoothly and looks beautiful.
